# geojson_tools
A set of Python tools to handle GeoJSON files for efficient management of region data, specifically related to areas. These tools allow you to generate prompts for AI-based assistance, interpret responses, and update your GeoJSON files accordingly.

## Main Goal:
This repository contains three Python files that serve different purposes in handling GeoJSON data. Two of these files can be executed as scripts, while the third contains a dictionary for area information. The main goal of these scripts is to simplify working with GeoJSON files by automating the process of interpreting and updating region-specific data like area sizes.

## 1: `geojson_interpret.py`
This script generates a formatted prompt for ChatGPT-4, which helps retrieve structured data for updating region areas.

### Usage:
To run the script, simply use the following command:

```bash
python geojson_interpret.py <filename>
```

- `<filename>`: The path to the GeoJSON file you want to process.

### Functionality:
- Reads a GeoJSON file and extracts region names.
- Formats a prompt asking for a dictionary with region names as keys and area sizes (in square kilometers) as values.
- This prompt can be used with ChatGPT-4 to generate the required data.

### Example:
```bash
python geojson_interpret.py UnitedStates.geojson
```

This will create a prompt listing all the regions in the specified GeoJSON file, ready to be fed into ChatGPT-4 for assistance.

## 2: `geojson_writer.py`
This script allows you to update the GeoJSON file with area data obtained from ChatGPT-4.

### Prerequisites:
You need to populate the `geojson_dict.py` file with the areas provided by ChatGPT-4 and the correct filename before running this script.

In `geojson_dict.py`, you should have:
- `filename`: The name of the GeoJSON file you want to modify.
- `geojson_dict`: A list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains a region name and its corresponding area in square kilometers.

### Usage:
After updating `geojson_dict.py` with the appropriate data, run:

```bash
python geojson_writer.py
```

### Functionality:
- Reads the GeoJSON file specified in `geojson_dict.py`.
- Updates the `AREA` field for each region with the values provided in `geojson_dict`.
- Saves the modified GeoJSON file.

### Example:
```python
# geojson_dict.py
filename = "UnitedStates.geojson"
geojson_dict = [{"California": 423967}, {"Texas": 695662}, {"NewYork": 141297}, ...]
```

After running `python geojson_writer.py`, the `UnitedStates.geojson` file will be updated with the area sizes specified in `geojson_dict.py`.

---

## 3: `geojson_dict.py`
This file contains the data necessary for updating the GeoJSON file. It should be manually updated with the ChatGPT-4 response.

### Structure:
- `filename`: The name of the GeoJSON file that will be modified.
- `geojson_dict`: A list of dictionaries, each containing the region name as the key and its area size in square kilometers as the value.

### Example:
```python
filename = "UnitedStates.geojson"
geojson_dict = [
    {"California": 423967},
    {"Texas": 695662},
    {"NewYork": 141297},
    {"Florida": 170312},
    ...
]
```

This file serves as the link between the interpreted data from ChatGPT-4 and the actual GeoJSON file you are working with.

## Recommendations:
- **Command Line Usage:** It's recommended to use these tools via the command line for fast and efficient data processing.
- **Future Plans:** In the future, a Tkinter-based graphical interface may be developed to allow for easier, more accessible modifications of GeoJSON data without requiring command-line knowledge.

---

### Final Thoughts:
These tools streamline the process of updating GeoJSON files, making it easy to interpret region-specific data and apply changes in bulk. This is especially useful when working with large datasets or when collaborating with AI-based tools like ChatGPT-4.
